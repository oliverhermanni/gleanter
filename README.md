gleanter
========

A (probably non-working) copy of my Startup Weekend Hamburg 2012 pitch.
It's based on CodeIgniter and MongoDB, everything pretty old from 2012,
I'm pretty sure it doesn't work anymore.

Just released for educational purposes.

A screenshot, what the app should look like is included. Might differ
from the actual included version.

The idea
--------
With gleanter I wanted to build a webapp that scans your Twitter timeline
for links and adds some meta data to it to make tweets with links more
readable.

Unfortunaly Twitter changed its API rules shortly after and so gleanter
couldn't become a product anymore.
